The "NeareestContourFG" test represents what happens when we look only at the
nearest contour points for foreground pixels, in the same way that we look at
nearest contour points for background pixels.

This test seems to do better than the default approach for the cube, broccoli soup,
and koala candy objects but worse for the clown and baking soda. Not sure why yet.
Though it's interesting that the former have sharp edges while the latter are smoother.
