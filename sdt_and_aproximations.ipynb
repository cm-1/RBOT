        "# How the PWP3D/RBOT approximations work\n",
        "\n",
        "See the GitHub branch for further explanation and what I believe are sign errors (that balance each other out) in the PWP3D and RBOT papers.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short: I believe that the true value of $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\xi}$ should be the negation of what the authors write, and that its missing negative sign would balance out the other one.\n",
        "The physical/intuitive interpretation of how the algorithm works, at least for BG pixels, is as follows. We will just work with BG pixels for now to simplify some things (e.g., so that \"signed distance\" from the contour can be assumed to be positive, making it just \"distance\") and because the interpretation seems a bit more \"sensible\" for BG pixels; for FG pixels, because they use the 3D point \"under\" the current pixel rather than the 3D point \"at\" the nearest contour pixel for calculations, there are some parts that I cannot fully incorporate into this interpretation, nor do I have a better alternative one yet.\n",
        "\n",
        "The RBOT paper represents $\\mathbf{x}$ as a function $\\mathbf{x}(\\xi)$ of $\\xi$, so that $\\partial\\mathbf{x} / \\partial \\xi$ is not 0 in general, and so that:\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "However, I find it more intuitive to view $\\mathbf{x}$ as constant, so that, not only do they not change colour (as in the previous, flawed interpretation) but they also do not change position in 2D/3D space either. Then we'd have $\\partial \\mathbf{x} / \\partial \\xi = 0$, and so that $\\partial \\Phi / \\partial \\xi \\neq 0$, we'll instead represent $\\Phi$ as a function of both $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\xi$, i.e., $\\Phi(\\mathbf{x}, \\xi)$. We'll also introduce a new function, $n(\\mathbf{x}, \\xi)$, which outputs the 2D coordinates of the nearest pixel to $\\mathbf{x}$ on the silhouette contour for the pose $\\xi$.\n",
        "Lastly, we'll use angle brackets to denote normalization; that is, for a vector $\\mathbf{v}$, we'll denote $\\langle \\mathbf{v} \\rangle = \\mathbf{v} / \\lVert \\mathbf{v} \\rVert$.\n",

        "Assuming that a unique $n(\\mathbf{x}, \\xi)$ exists for $\\mathbf{x}$, then $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\nabla \\Phi = \\langle \\,\\mathbf{x} - n(\\mathbf{x}, \\xi) \\,\\rangle = -\\langle \\,n(\\mathbf{x}, \\xi) - \\mathbf{x}\\,\\rangle$. Explanation/justification can be found [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2358675/gradient-of-the-distance-of-point-and-set) and [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/693520/the-gradient-of-a-distance-function). Thus, the finite-difference-calculated $\\frac{\\partial \\Phi(\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}$ calculated in the RBOT paper is essentially the same as $-\\langle \\,n(\\mathbf{x}, \\xi) - \\mathbf{x}\\,\\rangle$, which takes care of balancing out the other missing sign. And if you read through the RBOT code (in the `operator()` method of the `Parallel_For_computeJacobiansGN` class in `optimization_engine.h`), then you can see that what the RBOT paper reports as $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}}{\\partial \\xi}$ (which they represent by the equivalent $\\frac{\\partial \\pi}{\\partial \\xi}$, with $\\pi$ being the projection function taking 3D points to 2D) is _actually_ just $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial \\xi}$ for BG pixels _so long as_ the following assumption is made.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assumption is that WHICH 3D point on the model's surface becomes the nearest contour 2D point (under projection) to the (static) pixel $\\mathbf{x}$ won't change, but that WHERE said 3D point is will change.\n",
        "\n",
        "Viewed another way: it's like each pixel gets its own 1-point, radial SDT that it cares about. Or: it's like each pixel gets its own 1-vertex mesh that it is using to approximate the SDT derivatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the interpretation for FG pixels is a bit less clear, since they assume the nearest point would move by the same amount as the 3D point hit by a ray through the current pixel, and I'm not sure when that would be more accurate than just using the same model as the BG... but nonetheless, even just having the intuition for the BG might help.\n",
        "\n",
        "I _think_ my above interpretation/intuition is fairly decent, but maybe there's a better one; the authors never (as far as I can tell) clearly state that the above is being done, and further, the seemingly-mismatched sign stuff obscures such an interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "I decided to, as a test, see what happens in the RBOT code if you use the closest contour xyz when looking at the FG in the same way they are used for getting 3D points for the BG. On some objects, like the cube, koala candy, etc., accuracy is increased, while for others, like the baking soda and clown, accuracy is decreased. In both cases, though, the difference was fairly small. I still need to test more before making statements about a pattern, but so far, it's more obviously the sharp-edged prism-like objects for whom accuracy increased.\n",
